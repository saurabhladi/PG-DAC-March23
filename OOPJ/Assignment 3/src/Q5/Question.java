/*
  5. Develop a Java program to manage inventory items in a warehouse. The warehouse
     has a fixed number of storage shelves, and each shelf can store a maximum of 10
	 items. You need to create a program that allows the user to add and remove items
	 from the shelves, and also display the current contents of each shelf.
	 
	 
Requirements

	The program should use a static array to represent the shelves in the warehouse.
	The program should have a menu-driven interface that allows the user to choose
	from the following options:
	
		a. Add item to shelf
		b. Remove item from shelf
		c. Display contents of all shelves
		d. Exit
		
	When the user chooses to add an item to a shelf, the program should prompt the
	user to enter the name of the item and the shelf number (1-10).
	
	When the user chooses to remove an item from a shelf, the program should prompt
	the user to enter the shelf number (1-10) and remove the item from that shelf.
	
	When the user chooses to display the contents of all shelves, the program should
	print out the contents of each shelf in a tabular format, showing the shelf number and
	the items stored on that shelf.
	
	The program should handle invalid user input gracefully and display appropriate error
	messages.
