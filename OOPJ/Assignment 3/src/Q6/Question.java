/*
 6. Create a sales management program that will keep track of salespersons and their
 sales figures. The program should allow the user to add new salespersons, update
 existing ones, and view the total sales for each salesperson.

	The program should be implemented using Java arrays to store the salespersons'
	data. Each salesperson's data should include their name, ID, and an array of their
	sales figures for the past 12 months.
	
		The program should have the following functionality:
			a. Add a new salesperson: The user should be prompted to enter the
			salesperson's name, ID, and sales figures for each of the past 12 months.
			The program should create a new salesperson object and add it to the array
			of salespersons.
			
			b. Update an existing salesperson: The user should be prompted to enter the
			ID of the salesperson they wish to update. The program should then allow the
			user to update the sales figures for each of the past 12 months for that
			salesperson.
			
			c. View total sales for a salesperson: The user should be prompted to enter
			the ID of the salesperson they wish to view the total sales for. The program
			should then calculate the total sales for that salesperson and display it to the
			user.
			
			d. View total sales for all salespersons: The program should calculate the
			total sales for each salesperson and display them in a table.
			
			e. Exit the program: The user should be able to exit the program at any time
