/*
  4. Design a reservation system for a movie theater that uses Java arrays to keep track
     of available seats and sold seats. The system should allow customers to select seats
     and make reservations, as well as allow the theater staff to view the current seating
     arrangement and generate reports on ticket sales.
     
  Requirements:

	a. The system should display a seating chart with available and sold seats.
	
	b. Customers should be able to select seats by row and column numbers.
	
	c. The system should prevent customers from selecting already sold seats.
	
	d. Customers should be able to purchase multiple seats in a single transaction.
	
	e. The system should generate a unique reservation number for each
	   transaction.
	   
	f. The theater staff should be able to view a report of ticket sales, including the
	   number of seats sold and the revenue generated.
	   
	g. The theater staff should be able to view a report of available seats.
	
	h. The system should provide error messages for invalid user input, such as
	   selecting a non-existent seat.
