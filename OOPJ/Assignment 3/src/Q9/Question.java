/*
	9. designing a program in Java that utilizes the concept of enumerations. The program
	should simulate a simple restaurant menu ordering system, where the user can
	select from a predefined list of dishes and specify the quantity they wish to order.
	Requirements:
	
		a. Define an enumeration called Dish that contains a list of dishes offered by the
			restaurant. Each dish should have a name and a price associated with it.
			
		b. Implement a method called printMenu that prints the list of dishes along with
			their prices on the console.
			
		c. Implement a method called takeOrder that prompts the user to select a dish
			from the menu and specify the quantity they wish to order. The method
			should return the total cost of the order.
			
		d. The program should continue to take orders until the user chooses to exit.
		
		e. When the user exits, the program should print a summary of all the orders
			taken, including the name of the dish, quantity, and total cost.
			
			
Example:

	Welcome to Restaurant XYZ Menu Ordering System
	
	Menu:
		1. Dish1 - $10.00
			
		2. Dish2 - $15.00
		
		3. Dish3 - $8.00
		
		4. Dish4 - $12.00
		
			Please enter the dish number you wish to order: 1
			Please enter the quantity you wish to order: 2
			Total cost: $20.00
			
			Would you like to place another order? (Y/N): Y
			Please enter the dish number you wish to order: 3
			Please enter the quantity you wish to order: -1
			Invalid quantity entered. Please try again.
			
			Would you like to place another order? (Y/N): N
			Order summary:
			Dish1 - 2 - $20.00
			Dish3 - 3 - $24.00
			
			Thank you for your order!
