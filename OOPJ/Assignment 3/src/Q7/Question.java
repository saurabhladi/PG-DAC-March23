7. Create a Java program to perform various operations on matrices. The program
	should prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for two matrices,
	and then allow the user to input the elements of the matrices. The program should
	then display a menu of options for various matrix operations that the user can perform.
	
	The available operations should include:
		a. Addition of two matrices
		b. Subtraction of two matrices
		c. Multiplication of two matrices
		d. Transpose of a matrix
		
	After the user selects an operation, the program should perform the operation and
	display the result. If the operation is not possible, the program should display an
	appropriate error message.
