/*
3. Design an airline reservation system using Java Arrays. The system should allow
   users to make reservations for flights, view existing reservations, and cancel
   reservations.
   
   The system should have the following functionalities:
	a. User registration: The system should allow users to register with their name,
		email, and contact number.
	b. Flight availability: The system should have a pre-defined list of flights and
		their available seats. The user should be able to view the list of flights and
		their availability.
	c. Seat reservation: The user should be able to select a flight and reserve a
		seat. The system should allocate the seat to the user and update the
		availability of seats for the selected flight.
	d. View reservations: The user should be able to view their existing
		reservations along with the flight details.
	e. Cancel reservations: The user should be able to cancel their reservation.
	
The system should release the reserved seat and update the availability of
seats for the selected flight.
The system should be designed using Java Arrays and should include proper error
handling and exception handling mechanisms to handle cases such as invalid inputs,
seat availability, etc.
