/*
2. create a program that helps a restaurant manage their menu. The restaurant has 10
	dishes on their menu, and they want to be able to add, remove, and modify dishes
	easily.
	
	Your task is to create a Java program that uses arrays to store the menu items and
	their corresponding prices. The program should have a menu that allows the user to
	perform the following actions:
	
		a. View the current menu with prices
		b. Add a new dish to the menu
		c. Remove a dish from the menu
		d. Modify the price of a dish on the menu
		e. Exit the program
		
	When the user chooses to add a new dish, the program should prompt the user for
	the name of the dish and its price. The new dish should be added to the end of the
	menu array.
	
	When the user chooses to remove a dish, the program should prompt the user for
	the index of the dish they want to remove. The dish at that index should be removed
	from the menu array.

	When the user chooses to modify the price of a dish, the program should prompt the
	user for the index of the dish they want to modify and the new price. The price of the
	dish at that index should be updated in the menu array.
	
	After each action, the program should display the updated menu with prices. When
	the user chooses to exit the program, the program should display a farewell message
	and terminate.
