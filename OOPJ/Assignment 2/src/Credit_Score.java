10. Credit Score Calculator Practice Question

You have been asked to write a Java program to implement a credit score calculator.
The credit score calculator class should have the following fields:
    a. creditHistory: An int to represent the length of the individual's credit history.
    b. creditUtilization: A double to represent the percentage of available credit the individual is using.
    c. paymentHistory: A boolean to represent whether the individual has a good
       payment history or not.


The credit score calculator class should have the following methods:
    a. Constructors
    b. Getter and setter methods
    c. int calculateCreditScore(): A method to calculate the credit score based on the provided information.

The credit score should be calculated using the following formula:
    I. If the individual has a good payment history, the credit score should
         be calculated as follows:
            creditScore = (creditHistory * 15) + (int)(creditUtilization * 30) + 55
    II. If the individual has a bad payment history, the credit score should be calculated as follows:
        creditScore = (creditHistory * 15) + (int)(creditUtilization * 30) + 35
