You are required to write a Java program to calculate the telephone bill for a givencustomer based on their usage.
The program should take the following inputs from the user:
    a. Customer name
    b. Phone number
    c. Number of calls made
    d. Duration of calls (in minutes)

The program should then calculate the bill for the customer based on the following criteria:
    a. The first 100 calls are charged at a rate of 50 cents per call.
    b. Calls beyond the first 100 are charged at a rate of 25 cents per call.
    c. All calls are subject to a minimum duration of 1 minute.
    d. Calls with a duration less than 1 minute are rounded up to 1 minute.
    e. There is a flat rate of â‚¹10 per month for all customers.
